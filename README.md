<h1>Battleship Lite Application</h1>
<div>
  <p>This is a small console application mimicing battleship and developed alongside
    Tim Corey's C# MasterClass. Much of the console code was supplied but the the 
    game logic was developed independantly as homework and then checked against the
    provided work. Color formatting is additional as well.<p>
